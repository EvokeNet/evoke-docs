**AES-256**: Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key length. It's a symmetric encryption algorithm widely recognized for its security and speed.

**API**: Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other, facilitating data exchange and function calls.

**AWS**: Amazon Web Services. A subsidiary of Amazon offering cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments.

**AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: A managed service in AWS to create and control cryptographic keys.

**AWS Lightsail**: An Amazon AWS service that offers virtual private servers, databases, and other related services.

**Data Encryption**: The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

**Endpoint**: In computer networks, an endpoint is a remote computing device that communicates back to a connected network.

**The Evoke Hub**: The centralized system providing support for the Evoke game world across various platforms.

**gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source and universal remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

**Istio**: An open-source service mesh that provides a way to connect, manage, and secure microservices.

**Keycloak**: An open-source identity and access management solution.

**Microservices**: A software design pattern wherein applications are composed of small, independent modules that run as separate services.

**Monolithic Architecture**: A software design pattern where all components operate within a single, unified codebase.

**MQTT**: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. A lightweight messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

**Penetration Testing (PenTest)**: An authorized simulated cyberattack on a system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.
