# Tech enable distributed education

- Evoke campaigns are developed in an online platform where students form teams, post the results of their missions, receive peer and mentor reviews, earn evocoins, and create their evokation.
- The platform is infused with engaging game mechanics such as points, levels, evocoins and a marketplace where students can acquire tools to create their world changing idea.
- The platform also contains the game map, which is a map of the region where the Evoke campaign will happen facilitating a hyper local focus while connecting agents globally.
- Students move over the map to unlock challenges and bringaction into the real world.
