# Rewarding progress

- Youth who complete an Evoke campaign will receive micro-accreditation as a social innovator.  
- Mentors who support youth teams during a campaign will also receive accreditation as an Evoke mentor.
- Institutions will also be accredited and invited to become member insitutions in the Evoke network. These organizations would be reevaluated annually, to make sure they maintain Evoke standards.
