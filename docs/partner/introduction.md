# Partner Implementation Guide

Evoke is an award-winning, multi-player online educational experience, which uses storytelling, game mechanics, and social networks, to prepare young people to become social innovators who create solutions that address global ‘grand challenges’ (e.g., displacement, hunger, poverty, water scarcity). The Evoke project is designed to support young people as they develop an understanding of these complex challenges, acquire 21st century skills (e.g., creativity, collaboration, critical reflection), socio-emotional skills (e.g., curiosity, empathy, generosity), and gain the confidence to experiment, collaborate, and create innovative solutions.

**This guide outlines the Evoke Core federation architecture and how to build an environment to host Evoke campaigns**.
