# Storytelling in the core

- Story-driven content immerse youth in the “World of Evoke,” presenting missions to address global grand challenges.
- Agents complete missions as individuals and/or groups, working with mentors from implementation partners.
- An Evoke Core digital platform presents the campaign story, records agent work, and integrates reward mechanisms at scale to support any number of campaigns.
- Implementation partners include governments, educational institutions, and NGOs desiring to build capacities for social innovation to address global grand challenges among youth.
