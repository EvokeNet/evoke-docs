# Connecting students worldwide

- The Evoke network is a collaborative organization owned and managed by global partners working together to empower youth around the world with the skills and agency to recreate the future.
- Students who successfully complete an Evoke campaign may enter the network as a member supporting the next iteration in their community and owning a real stake in a global organization.
- Being part of the network is a privilege, not a right.  Each member is invited by a current member and must contribute and add value to the network.  We make our greatest efforts in making sure the Evoke Network is a safe and creative space for every participant.
